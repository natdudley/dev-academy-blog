            Describe a time you got blocked on a simple problem. What was the
            problem, what problem solving techniques did you use, how did you
            feel throughout the process, and what did you learn?
          </h2>
          <p>
            During sprint 4 of DevAcademy, we had a series of JavaScript Kata to
            complete. These were small coding challenges. I blasted through most
            of them on the first day. I was near the end, and it was past 6 PM
            in the evening, when I was asked to take an input on an array (a
            list of numbers) and calculate the average of that array.
          </p>
          <p>
            I knew it wasn’t a hard problem to solve so I skipped writing
            pseudocode and went straight to it, but the combination of tiredness
            and a new format with arrow notation and const (which results in a
            different way of laying out a function) meant I couldn’t figure it
            out. I went round and round in circles, console.logging everything,
            but getting more and more irritated. I decided to listen to my brain
            telling me I was tired and hungry and close my laptop for the night,
            even though I hate leaving a problem unsolved.
          </p>
          <p>
            After dinner, I described the problem to my partner, talking through
            how I was going to approach solving it the next day. The next
            morning, I sat down, wrote some pseudocode that followed the
            approach I’d figured out, and then wrote some actual code with
            step-by-step logging, and immediately was able to see the right path
            forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            It felt good to solve it, but also it felt good to have recognised
            when I was too tired to work and to have made the sensible decision
            to try again with a fresh brain, and not beat myself up about it. I
            learned that it’s important to listen to your body, and that even
            when it seems simple, writing pseudocode is a good idea.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Describe a time you solved a problem in an elegant way. What was the
            problem, what problem solving techniques did you use, how did you
            feel throughout the process, and what did you learn?
          </h2>
          <p>
            During the same sprint, one of the Kata asked us to “unjumble” a
            sentence which was written backwards. Before I started, I went and
            looked at the MDN docs to see what types of methods (like a
            technique) I could use to achieve this, and reading through these
            gave me an idea of how to approach the problem. I then wrote out
            pseudocode working through this step by step. Then, I started
            writing code, adding logging to every step so I could check what the
            outcomes were. Once I got to the correct outcome, I was delighted,
            but that delight was soon dashed by the tests not passing.
          </p>
          <h2>
            I was really confused, because I could see I was getting the right
            answer, but I wondered if maybe it was because there was a different
            way of solving it. I took a step back, and rethought my approach,
            and refactored my code to make it more simple and elegant. Like
            before, it output the correct answer, but still the tests didn’t
            pass. I was really frustrated at this point! I googled, but to no
            avail. I could not figure out why the test was failing.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I asked a peer for help, and together, we realised there was a
            problem with one of the tests. When we ran it in Chrome dev tools,
            it was fine, but in the tool we were using, it failed. They helped
            me rewrite the test so it would work in the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst I was frustrated at this, ultimately the tests failing made
            me go back and look at the problem again, and see a much nicer way
            to write the code.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving
            techniques and process:
          </h2>
          <h3>
            Pseudocode
          </h3>
          <p>
            I feel confident using this, and I regularly use this technique. I
            just have to remember not to skip it because a problem seems easy.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Trying something
          </h3>
          <p>
            I will totally always try something. This, combined with logging,
            can help to reduce uncertainty in the problem.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Rubber ducky method
          </h3>
          <p>
            I feel a bit silly doing this, especially in a shared space, but
            when I do it it helps a lot.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Reading error messages
          </h3>
          <p>
            I’m a bit less confident with this, but I do read them to see what
            they say and the line they occur on.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Console.logging
          </h3>
          <p>
            Always be console logging! I use this all the time.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Googling
          </h3>
          <p>
            Google is totally your best friend, although you have to pay close
            attention to the quality of the sources and how recently they were
            written in case they use deprecated approaches.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Asking your peers for help
          </h3>
          <p>
            I’ve done a bit of this, although it’s a bit harder when you’re a
            little ahead in the curriculum.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Asking coaches for help
          </h3>
          <p>
            I haven’t really done this, mainly because this is the first week I
            got stuck and my coach is away, heh.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Improving your process with reflection
          </h3>
          <p>
            I still feel a little silly doing this, but it’s becoming more
            useful.
